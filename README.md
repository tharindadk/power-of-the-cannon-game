# Power of the CANNON
Use your powerful cannon to occupy the enemy territory

## What is "Power of the CANNON"?
This is a 2D shooter game I developed for "Gamedev.js Jam 2024". I created this game using the Unity game engine.

## How to Play?
Your goal is to use a cannon to destroy the enemy. New enemy soldiers appear once their bullets hit our cannon or their soldiers' count is less than 1.  The center line shows the territory each side owns. Your goal is to occupy 100% of the territory.

**Controls**

Up and Down arrow keys - Move the cannon</br>
Space - Shoot
